## 🌟 Overview 🌟

This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLO algorithm and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract. It provides a simple and efficient way to detect objects in images or video streams and extract text from them. 📸

Key features include: 🛠️

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8n pre-trained model. 🖼️
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract for text extraction. 📝
- Support for live webcam feed for both object detection and OCR. 📹

## 💻 Installation 💻

1. **Clone the repository:** 📦

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohan-Gautam/Object-Detection-and-OCR.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** 🚶

   ```bash
   cd Object-Detection-and-OCR
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:** ⚙️

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Use the provided scripts to utilize the functionalities:** 🧩

   - **To run object detection, execute:** 🕵️‍♂️

     ```bash
     python object_detection.py
     ```

     This will activate your webcam and commence real-time object detection. 🎥

   - **For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on detected objects, run:** 📖

     ```bash
     python ocr.py
     ```

     This script will extract text from objects detected in the webcam feed. 📄

✨ Happy coding! ✨
