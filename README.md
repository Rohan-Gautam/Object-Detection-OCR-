# ✨ Object Detection and OCR ✨

[![🚀 Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Rohan-Gautam/Object-Detection-and-OCR/actions)

## 🌟 Overview 🌟

Welcome to **Object Detection and OCR**! This project implements real-time object detection using the powerful YOLO algorithm and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract. It provides an intuitive and efficient solution to detect objects in images or video streams and extract text from them. 📸

### Key Features 🛠️

- **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8n pre-trained model for robust and swift object detection.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Employs Tesseract to accurately extract text from images.
- **Live Webcam Feed Support:** Enjoy seamless object detection and OCR on live webcam feed.

## 💻 Installation 💻

1. **Clone the repository:** 📦

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohan-Gautam/Object-Detection-and-OCR.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** 🚶

   ```bash
   cd Object-Detection-and-OCR
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:** ⚙️

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Use the provided scripts to utilize the functionalities:** 🧩

   - **To run object detection, execute:** 🕵️‍♂️

     ```bash
     python object_detection.py
     ```

     This will activate your webcam and commence real-time object detection. 🎥

   - **For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on detected objects, run:** 📖

     ```bash
     python ocr.py
     ```

     This script will extract text from objects detected in the webcam feed. 📄

## Usage

Unlock the potential of **Object Detection and OCR** for various purposes:

- Use the `object_detection.py` script to perform real-time object detection.
- Leverage the `ocr.py` script to extract text from detected objects in the live webcam feed.

## Example Output

Here's a glimpse of the astounding capabilities of our project:

![Object Detection - Bottle](path/to/bottle_detection.png)

Witness the object detection prowess as it successfully identifies a bottle on the table. The bounding box elegantly outlines the bottle's location in the image.

![Object Detection - Person](path/to/person_detection.png)

Behold as the algorithm detects a person's hand in the scene. The bounding box impeccably delineates the precise location of the detected person.

✨ Happy coding and exploring! ✨
